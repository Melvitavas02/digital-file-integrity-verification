# 🔐 Digital File Integrity Verification System
A cybersecurity web application that verifies file integrity using **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing**.


# 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how digital investigators verify file authenticity using cryptographic hash values. Any small modification in a file produces a completely different hash, helping detect tampering or unauthorized changes.


# 🚀 Features
- Upload any file
- Generate SHA-256 hash fingerprint
- Verify file integrity
- Detect file tampering
- Persistent hash storage using browser Local Storage
- Copy hash functionality
- Professional cybersecurity dashboard UI


# 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Web Crypto API
- Browser Local Storage


# 🔐 Cybersecurity Concepts
- Cryptographic Hashing (SHA-256)
- Data Integrity Verification
- Digital Forensics Workflow
- Evidence Validation
- Tamper Detection


#⚙️ How It Works
1. Upload a file
2. Generate SHA-256 hash
3. Hash is stored as reference
4. Re-upload file for verification
5. System compares hashes to detect modification
